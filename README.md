# CNN_Reduction
This repository contains the source code and analysis for the project "Comparative Analysis of Dimensionality Reduction Methods for CNN Features."
The goal is to evaluate four dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP, Autoencoders, and a Novel Transformer) on high-dimensional feature vectors (2048D) extracted from a ResNet50 model to compress them down to 128D, while minimizing the loss of classification accuracy.
